[VOC Analysis Guideline]
1. Output Format: STRICTLY follow the Markdown format defined in the prompt.
2. Tone: Use 'Eum-seum-che' (ending with noun or ~m/um) for summaries.
3. Classification:
   - Payment issues -> Billing_Team
   - App crash/bugs -> Tech_Team
   - UI/UX complaints -> Design_Team
4. Critical Rule: Always identify the specific 'Error Type' if mentioned (e.g., 'Memory Error', 'Payment Gateway Timeout').
